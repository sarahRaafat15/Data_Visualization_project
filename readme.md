## Summary of Findings

The average duration of the trip is about 500 sec.
The number of customer is slightly bigger than that of  sucscribers
There is an increase in the number of rides during weekdays compared to weekends(Saturday,Sunday) .
We also see that most of the rides start at 8 a.m or 5 p.m ,which are the times where most of people go and return from work.
The rental access method most used is the app.
Bike rides duration on weekends is slightly less than those of weekdays .
Bikers with rental method "app" have longer rides compared to those whose rental method is clipper.
Tuesday , 8 a.m has the biggest number of rides.
Tuesday and Monday has the most rides of both customers and subscribers .
Customers have longer rides than subscribers .Subscribres have significantly shorter rides on weekends compared to other days
Bikers who rent using app show approximately equal trip durations across different days of the week.However those whose rental_access_method is clipper ,their trip durations is widely varied.
Overall both customers and subscribers pattern does not differ much in the pattern of their rides but we notice that on weekends,Customers appear to make rides more than Subscribers.
